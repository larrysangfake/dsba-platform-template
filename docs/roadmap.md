# üìä Stock Advisory App Roadmap

## üõ†Ô∏è Q2 2025 - Initial Prototype

### Goals:
- Build a basic stock advisory system focusing on **hold vs. sell** recommendations.
- Integrate **Random Forest** for next-day stock price movement prediction.
- Implement **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate potential gains.

### Deliverables:
- Random Forest model for predicting next-day price movement.
- Monte Carlo simulation for future price forecasting.
- REST API to receive user inputs and return actionable recommendations.
- Basic client interface to visualize:
  - Historical price trend.
  - Monte Carlo forecast.
  - Hold/Sell recommendation with confidence.

### Key Milestones:
- ‚úÖ Random Forest Model Training (April 2025)
- ‚è≥ Monte Carlo Simulation Integration (May 2025)
- ‚è≥ REST API Development (May 2025)
- ‚è≥ Frontend Dashboard Prototype (June 2025)

## üîç Q4 2025 - Monitoring & Feedback Loop

### Goals:
- Set up monitoring for model drift and prediction quality.
- Implement feedback loops to retrain the model with new stock data.
- Introduce alerting for confidence-level drops.

### Deliverables:
- Monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana for:
  - Model confidence over time
  - Prediction error rates
  - Monte Carlo outcome distribution
- Automated retraining pipeline (triggered by GitHub Actions).

### Key Milestones:
- ‚è≥ Implement Model Monitoring (October 2025)
- ‚è≥ Feedback Data Collection System (November 2025)
- ‚è≥ Automated Retraining Integration (December 2025)
